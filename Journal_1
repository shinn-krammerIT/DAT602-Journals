Week 2 (1st - 5th March)

On this week our class was introduced to the course. With that we went over the course outline and worked on getting started with our journals and first Milestone. 
This week CRUD was looked at as well. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. These 4 actions are the core to working with Databases. (What Is CRUD? | Codecademy, n.d.) Further into the course we will learn how to deveelop a CRUD table for our assignment. 
I also installed mySQL in class. I have yet to connect it to VS code.
